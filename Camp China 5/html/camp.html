        <h1>Information about travel</h1>
        <p>The majority of camps will expect you to head out to the states within the first two weeks of June, as long as you're available before 18th June, we can get you to the States. You'll be there for approximately 8-9 weeks and then as part of your J1 visa are given a 30 day grace period. Don't forget, we have our incredible New York After Party to see the sights of the city that never sleeps!
          When do I need to be available?
          Ideally, most camps begin to hire from the middle of June. Camp runs for approximately 9 weeks from the second week in June until mid August. We can only accept applications with availability upto the 18th of June 2017, if can start only after this date please contact the office and we'll consider your options. The earlier your availability the better, camps start hiring for some positions from May 1st, if you do work longer than 9 weeks (11 weeks for a day camp) you will get paid a daily rate on top of your initial salary.
          How old do I need to be to apply?
          <br>
          You must be 18 by June 1st 2017 in order to apply for Camp Canada in 2017 and 2018 unfortunately this is non-negogatible. You can apply for Camp Canada if you are 17 as long as you turn 18 before June 1st 2017. If you're under 18 please contact us, we have several other programmes that would be suitable for you.
          <br>
          Is there a application deadline?
          <br>
          We will be taking applications until Friday 17th March 2017 if you want to apply after this date please contact the office to discuss your options. Applying after the deadline will reduces the changes of securing your placement.
          <br>
          Do I need any qualifications to apply?
          <br>
          Qualifications in certain areas are desirable (take lifeguarding for example) but they are not essential, personal experience is really valuable combined with positive 'can do' attitude. Add as many skills as possible to your application, even if you don't have the ability to teach it, the more skills and experience you have in different areas the better as it shows you are a good all round candidate. You don't necessarily need extensive experience teaching or working with children in order to apply, but you must be able to demonstrate a desire to work with children and make sure they have the Summer of a lifetime.
          <br>
Am I covered with medical insurance?
<br>
Yes, as part of your programme fees you will get 90 days of medical insurance to cover accident and illness. This will cover your time at camp including your days off and for most standard 9 weeks contracts will cover your 30 day grace period. This can be extended both before and after your contracted dates and can also be upgraded to premium coverage.
<br>
Can I travel after camp?
<br>
Yes, after your camp contract finishes you will get a 30 day grace period to go and see the sights. If you are looking for inspiration check out our amazing AmeriCamp After Party in New York!
<br>
Will there be a charge for my medical form?
<br>
This can vary greatly depending on what Doctor's surgery you attend, typically you shouldn't be paying more than £40-£60 however some do charge much higher fees, it is your doctors decision regarding how much they charge. Please give us a call in the office if the charge is over £60, we can give you some suggestions to help bring the cost down.
<br>
Do I have to accept the first job offer?
<br>
Please speak to us first if you are considering to turn down your first placement offer. We will take a look at the reasons why the camp might not suit and can make changes to your application. If you really feel that the camp isn't the best fit we will do our best to #plACe you elsewhere, however we can't guarantee you would be offered a second placement. Every camp we work with are truly amazing and you will have the summer of a lifetime wherever you end up.</p>
